FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the clients side and the microservices
- Using the middle end when client send request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to the request
- We can do message validation,response transformation, rate limiting.
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as middle end
